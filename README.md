## **Tips**
    If you've made it this far, you must be a geek ü§ì like me. Want some tips?
    -The dragon has a shorter attack range on its right side, so try attacking from there.
    -If the dragon collides with meteorites, it will destroy them.
    -The game warns you not to reach 0 HP ‚Äî if the dragon has low HP, you can afford to lose some, but be careful.
    -You have 100 HP, the dragon has 500 HP, and you both deal 10 damage per hit.
    -Every 60 seconds, meteorites appear. Each meteorite heals the dragon by 5 HP every 10 seconds.

Enjoy the game and good luck defeating the dragon! üêâ

## **Tasks for the second project**
```
  -The Player, Monster, and Meteorite classes are derived from the Entity base class.
  -The update virtual function, defined in the Meteorite class and specific to the theme, is invoked through a pointer to the base class.
  -In the Meteorite class we find a virtual constructor.
  -In the Player's constructor we find the call of the Entity's constructor.
  -Entity has operator overloading = and dynamic cast in the Meteorite class.
  -The FileLoadException, InvalidEntityException, StateException exceptions from GameException.
```

## **Tasks for the third project**
```
  -I've made GameManager and Player singleton classes.
  -I‚Äôve made GameManager a template class. Now, if needed, it can be used for other entities as well (with slight modifications to the function names [Update/update with uppercase/lowercase] and possibly a few [pure] virtual functions, but I don‚Äôt need to do that right now).
  -Implemented the removeIfPtr template function to verify if the meteorites are alive. If they aren't(checked by the lambda function) it will remove them from the vector.
